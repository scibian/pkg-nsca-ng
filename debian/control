Description: Monitoring command acceptor
 The NSCA-ng server makes the Nagios command file accessible from remote
 systems.  This allows for submitting passive check results, downtimes, and many
 other commands to Nagios or Icinga.
 .
 The communication with clients is TLS
 encrypted and authenticated using pre-shared keys (as per RFC 4279).  The
 NSCA-ng server supports per-client passwords and fine-grained authorization
 control.
