NSCA-ng's "contrib" Directory
=============================

This directory contains a collection of scripts that may be useful.  All
scripts except for `nsca-ng.init` allow for specifying the path to the
`send_nsca.cfg(5)` file via `-c <path>`.  Other `send_nsca(8)` options can
be specified by setting the environment variable `SEND_NSCA_ARGS`.  All
scripts print usage information when called with the `-h` option.

* `acknowledge`

    Acknowledges a problem using `send_nsca(8)`.  If the `-S` option is
    specified, a service problem is acknowledged; otherwise, a host problem
    is acknowledged.  Example invocation:

        $ acknowledge -H www -S HTTP

* `debug_server`

    Opens a raw TLS connection to the `nsca-ng(8)` server, sends any lines
    read from the standard input, and prints any server responses to the
    standard output.  Requires `s_client(1)` from OpenSSL 1.0.0 or newer,
    and `xxd(1)`.  Example invocation:

        $ debug_server -c /etc/send_nsca.cfg

* `disable_notifications`

    Globally disables host and service notifications using `send_nsca(8)`.
    Example invocation:

        $ disable_notifications

* `downtime`

    Schedules a host or service downtime using `send_nsca(8)`.  If the `-S`
    option is used, a service downtime is scheduled; otherwise, a host
    downtime is scheduled.  The start and end times are specified with the
    `-s` and `-e` options, respectively.  They accept the same date string
    format as GNU `date(1)'s` `-d` option.  Requires GNU `date(1)` or BSD
    `date(1)`.  Example invocation (the `-s` and `-e` options could be
    omitted here, as these are their default values):

        $ downtime -H mail -S IMAP -s now -e +2hours

* `enable_notifications`

    Globally enables host and service notifications using `send_nsca(8)`.
    Example invocation:

        $ enable_notifications

* `invoke_check`

    Executes standard plugins and transmits their results using
    `send_nsca(8)`.  Example invocation:

        $ invoke_check check_disk -w 20% -c 10%

* `nsca-ng.init`

    Starts, stops, restarts, or reloads the `nsca-ng(8)` server running on
    the local system.  Example invocation:

        $ nsca-ng.init start
