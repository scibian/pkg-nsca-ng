NSCA-ng Release History
=======================

Changes in Release 1.4 (2014-10-14)
-----------------------------------

- Fix NSCA-ng's systemd support: Actually send the keep-alive packets
  expected by the watchdog.
- Include an experimental NSCA-ng client module for Python.

Changes in Release 1.3 (2014-07-15)
-----------------------------------

- Make the server play nicely with systemd by providing a systemd.service(5)
  file and adding optional support for socket activation as well as other
  systemd features, such as watchdog supervision.  When compiled with
  systemd support, the server enables these features automatically if it was
  socket activated.
- Fix an issue that prevented compilation on (at least) Solaris and FreeBSD
  and caused a fatal startup error on (at least) NetBSD and OpenBSD.
- Make sure our copy of FreeBSD's pidfile(3) code isn't used if the system
  provides it.  The Autoconf test got this wrong in certain cases.
- Don't buffer log output written to the standard error output.
- Accept CRLF-terminated client configuration files.
- Apply a few minor fixes.

Changes in Release 1.2 (2013-11-06)
-----------------------------------

- Let nsca-ng.cfg(5)'s `include` directive and nsca-ng(8)'s `-c` flag accept
  directory path names.  If a directory is specified, read the server
  configuration from all `*.cfg` and `*.conf` files in the specified
  directory and all subdirectories.
- Let the client's `-d` and `-e` flags accept C-style escape sequences, so
  that e.g. `-e '\n'` can be specified.  Octal and hexadecimal numbers are
  also accepted.
- Allow for specifying authorization settings outside of the `authorize`
  sections in nsca-ng.cfg(5) files.  They will then serve as a fallback for
  `authorize` sections that don't define these settings.
- Fix a race condition in the case where the command file is recreated after
  the NSCA-ng server had opened it.
- Fix a crash of the client on 32-bit platforms that use 64-bit timestamps.
- Don't use half-broken POSIX AIO implementations such as the one provided
  by Debian GNU/kFreeBSD 7.
- Apply test suite fixes for GNU Hurd.
- Update our copy of libev from version 4.11 to version 4.15.  The new
  release provides a number of bug fixes and minor enhancements.
- Apply some minor cleanups.

Changes in Release 1.1 (2013-04-12)
-----------------------------------

- Add chroot(2) support to the server.
- Let the server accept `hosts` patterns in `authorize` sections.  They're
  syntactic sugar for allowing host checks to be submitted (analogous to the
  `services` patterns for service check submissions).
- Let the client ignore empty input lines.  This fixes some corner cases
  where NSCA-ng's client didn't accept the same input as the client provided
  with the original NSCA package.
- Add the `-e` client option, which allows for specifying a delimiter to use
  instead of the ASCII ETB character for separating check results.
- Let the `invoke_check` script (provided in the `contrib` directory of the
  source tarball) survive plugin return codes other than zero.  This should
  make the script slightly more useful :-)
- Apply a few minor improvements.

Changes in Release 1.0 (2013-03-06)
-----------------------------------

- Actually use the POSIX AIO API if it's provided by the target system.  The
  corresponding Autoconf test was broken since version 0.2.
- When opening the command file, check whether it's a named pipe.  If it's
  not, log a warning message and retry opening it later on.
- Use the PSK-AES256-CBC-SHA cipher suite (instead of PSK-RC4-SHA) by
  default.
- Apply various minor fixes and improvements.

Changes in Release 0.3 (2013-02-25)
-----------------------------------

- First public release.
- Fix the server's `-s` and `-S` options.  They were effectively ignored.
- Mention the session ID in all log messages related to the TLS
  communication in order to ease debugging.
- Apply a few minor cleanups.

Changes in Release 0.2 (2013-02-19, Unpublished)
------------------------------------------------

- Accept non-numeric service check result status when matching against
  service patterns.
- Don't accept spurious service check results.  This could have happened
  when service patterns without host name part were specified.
- Mention the session ID when refusing data.
- Fix the client's `-s` option.  It was effectively ignored.
- Don't link the client against the libraries used only by the server.
- Apply various minor cleanups.

Changes in Release 0.1 (2013-02-08, Unpublished)
------------------------------------------------

- Initial release.
