.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
The
.B send_nsca
utility transmits one or more check results or monitoring commands to an
.BR nsca\-ng (8)
server.
The communication with the server is
.SM TLS
encrypted and authenticated using pre-shared keys (as per
.SM RFC
4279).
By default,
.B send_nsca
reads host or service check results from the standard input.
Multiple check results must be separated with an
.SM ASCII ETB
character (octal value: 27).
Service check results are expected to be in the following format:
.
.PP
.IR 	host [tab] service [tab] status [tab] message [newline]
.
.PP
where
.I host
and
.I service
are the host name and service description as configured in Nagios,
.I status
is the numeric return code, and
.I message
is the output string.
Host check results are expected to be in the same format, just without
the
.I service
description:
.
.PP
.IR 	host [tab] status [tab] message [newline]
.
.PP
Note that multiline
.IR message s
are supported.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.B \-C
.
Instead of accepting host or service check results in the format
described above, read \(lqraw\(rq monitoring commands for submission to
the Nagios command file from the standard input, one command per line.
The commands are expected to be in the format described in the Nagios
documentation; except that the leading bracketed timestamp may be
omitted, in which case the current timestamp is prepended to the
provided command by
.BR send_nsca .
.
.TP
.BI \-c\  file
.
Read the configuration from the specified
.I file
instead of using the default configuration file
.IR @sysconfdir@/send_nsca.cfg .
.
.TP
.BI \-D\  delay
.
Wait for a random number of seconds between 0 and the specified
.I delay
before contacting the server.
This might be useful to reduce the server load if many
.B send_nsca
clients are invoked simultaneously.
The default setting is 0, which tells
.B send_nsca
to connect to the server immediately.
If this option is specified, the
.B delay
setting in the
.BR send_nsca.cfg (5)
file is ignored.
.
.TP
.BI \-d\  delimiter
.
Use the specified
.I delimiter
instead of a horizontal tab to separate the fields when parsing host or
service check results.
The
.I delimiter
must be a single character, a C-style backslash escape sequence, the
octal value of a character with a leading zero, or the hexadecimal value
of a character prefixed with \(lq0x\(rq.
Any
.SM ASCII
character other than a backslash, newline,
.SM ETB,
or
.SM NUL
is allowed.
This option is ignored if the
.B \-C
option is specified.
.
.TP
.BI \-e\  separator
.
Use the specified
.I separator
instead of an
.SM ASCII ETB
character to separate multiple host or service check results.
The
.I separator
must be a single character, a C-style backslash escape sequence, the
octal value of a character with a leading zero, or the hexadecimal value
of a character prefixed with \(lq0x\(rq.
Any
.SM ASCII
character is allowed, but note that multiline check result messages
cannot be submitted if a newline character is used.
This option is ignored if the
.B \-C
option is specified.
.
.TP
.BI \-H\  server
.
Connect and talk to the specified
.I server
address or host name.
By default,
.B send_nsca
attempts to communicate with \(lqlocalhost\(rq.
This option takes precedence over the
.B server
setting in the
.BR send_nsca.cfg (5)
file.
.
.TP
.B \-h
.
Print usage information to the standard output and exit.
.
.TP
.BI \-o\  timeout
.
Close the connection if the server didn't respond for the specified
number of seconds.
If the
.I timeout
is set to 0,
.B send_nsca
won't enforce connection timeouts.
The default
.I timeout
is 15 seconds.
This option is provided for compatibility with
.SM NSCA
2.x.
If it's specified, the
.B timeout
setting in the
.BR send_nsca.cfg (5)
file is ignored.
.
.TP
.BI \-p\  port
.
Connect to the specified service name or
.I port
number instead of using the default
.I port
(5668).
This option takes precedence over the
.B port
setting in the
.BR send_nsca.cfg (5)
file.
.
.TP
.B \-S
.
Write all messages to the standard error output.
This is the default behaviour.
.
.TP
.B \-s
.
Send all messages (except for usage errors) to the system logger.
This option may be combined with the
.B \-S
option.
.
.TP
.B \-t
.
This option is ignored.
It is accepted for compatibility with
.SM NSCA
2.x.
.
.TP
.B \-V
.
Print version information to the standard output and exit.
.
.TP
.B \-v
.
Generate a message for each check result or monitoring command sent to
the
.BR nsca\-ng (8)
server.
This option can be specified up to three times in order to increase the
verbosity.
.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.
The
.B send_nsca
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.
.SH FILES

.TP
.I @sysconfdir@/send_nsca.cfg
